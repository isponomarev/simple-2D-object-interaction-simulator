# simple-2D-object-interaction-simulator
Motion simulator for simple 2D objects.

You have a field with dimensions that you can change.

On the field you can place simple objects: rectangles and circles.

The objects have initial parameters: mass, coordinates of the center of grevity, speed and its direction.
The simulator sets simulation time and objects move across depending on their coordinates and speeds.
Objects bounce off field borders and other objects.
At any time, you can see the parameters of the object on the field.
